Using Python/SQL for data cleaning and manipulation, and extract relevant information, such as the most popular genres, viewing times, and user ratings. This analysis not only provided insights into audience behavior but also helped identify potential areas for content development and marketing strategies.\n","\n","Top 20 Cities by Number of Events: This project involved gathering and analyzing data on events from various sources to determine the top 20 cities with the highest number of events. I utilized SQL/Python to aggregate data, allowing me to efficiently analyze and visualize the results. By applying SQL/Python for data visualization, I created informative charts that illustrated the distribution of events across these cities, enabling stakeholders to understand patterns and make informed decisions regarding event planning and promotion.\n","\n","Analyzing Industry Carbon Emissions: In this project, I analyzed a dataset representing over 75% of global carbon emissions to identify the highest emitting industries for the most recent year. Utilizing SQL skills, I summarized data to aggregate emissions by industry and filtered grouped data to isolate the top emitters. Through this analysis, I gained insights into the significant contributors to global carbon emissions and enhanced my proficiency in SQL.\n","\n","Analyzing Motorcycle Part Sales: In the \"Analyzing Motorcycle Part Sales\" project, I examined sales data from a company selling motorcycle parts to gain insights into their wholesale revenues across three warehouse sites. Using SQL, I determined the monthly net revenue generated by different product lines and warehouses. This project required strong reporting skills in addition to SQL, allowing me to help the company understand their revenue streams and make data-driven decisions.\n","\n","What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses : In this Python project, I analyzed data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk to uncover fascinating insights about the world's oldest businesses. By examining various database tables and employing joining techniques, I discovered the range of founding years, the oldest company and its industry, companies founded before 1000 AD, and the most common industries among these ancient businesses. I also identified the oldest companies by continent and the prevalent industries on each continent. This project enhanced my Python skills, particularly in data merging, and provided intriguing findings about business longevity. \n","\n","Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores: In this project, I worked with a SQL database containing SAT scores from New York City's public schools to analyze test performance. I examined how many schools fail to report information, identified the best and worst performing schools in reading, math, and writing, and determined the top 10 schools by average total SAT scores. Additionally, I analyzed test performance variations by borough and pinpointed the top 5 schools by average SAT scores for each borough. This project honed my SQL skills and provided valuable insights into the academic performance of NYC public schools.\n","\n","Analyze International Debt Statistics : In this project, I investigated international debt data collected by The World Bank to uncover key insights. I determined the number of countries with debt, the total debt owed globally, and identified the country with the highest debt along with its amount. Additionally, I calculated the average debt across different debt indicators and identified the most common debt indicator. This analysis enhanced my data analysis skills and provided a deeper understanding of global debt patterns.\n","\n","In my project titled \"Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue,\" I aimed to develop actionable recommendations to help an online sports clothing company maximize its revenue. This involved analyzing a diverse set of product data, including prices, discounts, revenue, ratings, reviews, product descriptions, and website traffic. Through this analysis, I sought to answer critical questions such as the differences in price points between Nike and Adidas, the variations in discounts offered, and the correlation between revenue and reviews.\n","To tackle these challenges, I employed advanced SQL techniques like aggregation, summarization, and correlation analysis, as well as data cleaning and manipulation. I also explored trends in monthly reviews and assessed the contribution of footwear to the overall stock and its revenue compared to clothing items. This project not only enhanced my SQL skills but also deepened my understanding of data-driven decision-making in the retail sector.\n","\n","In my project titled \"When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?\", I set out to analyze the top 400 best-selling video games released since 1977 to determine how the gaming market has evolved over time and identify its most prosperous periods. My goal was to uncover insights such as the top 10 best-selling games of all time, the years with the highest average critic and user scores, and the correlation between these scores and the number of games sold.To achieve this, I utilized advanced SQL techniques, including various joins and set operators, to synthesize data from multiple sources effectively. This allowed me to pinpoint significant trends, such as the years that produced the most hits and had the highest average scores from both critics and players. This project not only honed my SQL skills but also deepened my appreciation for the historical context of video gaming and its evolving landscape.\n","\n","In my project titled \"Analyzing American Baby Name Trends,\" I explored data from the U.S. Social Security Administration that tracked first names given to over 5,000 American babies each year for 101 years. My primary goal was to understand the evolving tastes in American baby names by investigating trends in their popularity. I delved into classic American names, identifying which ones have remained timeless versus those that are more trendy.Throughout the analysis, I uncovered fascinating insights, such as the top 10 female names, the most popular female name ending in \"a\" since 2015, and the most popular male names by year. Additionally, I determined which male name held the title for the most years of popularity. To accomplish this, I employed advanced SQL techniques for data manipulation, further enhancing my skills in analyzing large datasets and uncovering meaningful trends in cultural preferences over time."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
